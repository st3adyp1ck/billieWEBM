# üöÄ Railway Deployment Guide - Fixed Version

## üîß Issues Fixed

The 500 error on Railway has been resolved by addressing these critical issues:

### 1. **Missing Error Handling**
- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks around all async operations
- Added global error handler for unhandled errors
- Added detailed logging for debugging

### 2. **FFmpeg Path Detection**
- Improved FFmpeg detection for Railway's environment
- Added fallback paths for different cloud platforms
- Added detailed FFmpeg availability checking

### 3. **Directory Issues**
- Fixed directory creation for Railway's ephemeral filesystem
- Using `/tmp` directory for uploads/output on production
- Added write permission verification

### 4. **Multer Error Handling**
- Added proper error middleware for file upload failures
- Better handling of file size limits and format validation

### 5. **Railway-Specific Configuration**
- Updated `railway.json` with health check endpoint
- Added environment-specific configurations
- Improved FFmpeg detection for Railway's default environment

## üìã Deployment Steps

### 1. **Push Updated Code**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment issues - comprehensive error handling and FFmpeg detection"
git push origin main
```

### 2. **Deploy on Railway**
- Railway will automatically detect the changes and use Nixpacks
- Railway's default environment should include FFmpeg
- Health check endpoint `/health` will verify everything is working
- If FFmpeg is missing, Railway logs will show detailed error information

### 3. **Monitor Deployment**
- Check Railway logs for the detailed startup messages
- Visit `/health` endpoint to verify all services are working
- Look for these success messages in logs:
  ```
  === FFMPEG SETUP ===
  === SERVER CONFIGURATION ===
  === DIRECTORY SETUP ===
  === SERVER STARTED ===
  ```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Check Health Status
Visit: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/health`

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "environment": {
    "platform": "linux",
    "nodeVersion": "v18.x.x",
    "isRailway": true,
    "isProduction": true
  },
  "services": {
    "ffmpeg": true,
    "directories": true,
    "uploadsDir": "/tmp/uploads",
    "outputDir": "/tmp/output"
  }
}
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **FFmpeg Not Found**
   - Railway should have FFmpeg available by default
   - Check Railway build logs for any FFmpeg-related errors
   - If needed, you can add a custom nixpacks.toml file with: `[phases.setup]\nnixPkgs = ["ffmpeg"]`

2. **Directory Permission Errors**
   - Should automatically use `/tmp` on Railway
   - Check logs for "Directory write permissions verified"

3. **File Upload Still Fails**
   - Check Railway logs for detailed error messages
   - Verify file size is under 500MB limit
   - Ensure file format is supported

## üìä New Features Added

### Health Check Endpoint
- **URL**: `/health`
- **Purpose**: Verify all services are working
- **Used by**: Railway's health check system

### Enhanced Logging
- Detailed startup information
- Request logging for debugging
- Error stack traces for troubleshooting

### Better Error Messages
- User-friendly error responses
- Detailed server logs for debugging
- Proper HTTP status codes

## üéØ Expected Behavior

1. **Startup**: Server should start with detailed logs
2. **Health Check**: `/health` should return 200 OK
3. **File Upload**: Should work without 500 errors
4. **Conversion**: Should process videos correctly
5. **Download**: Should provide converted files

## üö® If FFmpeg Issues Persist

If you get FFmpeg-related errors during deployment:

1. **Check Railway logs** for FFmpeg availability
2. **Visit `/health` endpoint** to see FFmpeg status
3. **If FFmpeg is missing**, rename `nixpacks.toml.backup` to `nixpacks.toml`:
   ```bash
   mv nixpacks.toml.backup nixpacks.toml
   git add nixpacks.toml
   git commit -m "Add FFmpeg to nixpacks configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```
4. **Redeploy** and check logs again

## üö® Other Issues

1. Check Railway deployment logs
2. Visit `/health` endpoint
3. Test with a small video file first
4. Check browser console for client-side errors
5. Verify all files are committed and pushed to git

The deployment should now work correctly on Railway! üéâ
